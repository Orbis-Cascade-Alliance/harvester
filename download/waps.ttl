The effort was appropriate, as the reason for Governor Hay's visit was to speak on the feasibility of connecting Wenatchee with the Okanogan/Methow region by highway. Mayor Kerr, William Brown, W.C. Muldrow, P.M. Snider, A.M. Storch and Charles A. Johnson went along for the ride to greet him. They drove him on state roads to the Government Irrigation Project in Conconully, then to lunch at the Okanogan Hotel, followed by a short speech and townspeople reception at the Okanogan Auditorium. Claude George and Barton Robinson of the Omak delegation and Charley Blackwell, F.J. Cummings, H.H. Proctor and Dr. H.M. Fryer from Riverside were ready to take Goveror Hay to the next stop on his "Good Roads" tour. In this photograph, directly behind the left car's window is Mayor Harry J. Kerr (standing, derby hat). In the driver's seat is Johnnie Bassett of the Bassett Stage Line in Brewster. Behind him is Governor Hay, and sitting next to the governor is Barton Robinson. In the middle car is Charley E. Blackwell (behind the wheel) and Jack Williams (beside him). The rear seat carries John H. O'Keefe and Ford H. Towne, both of Okanogan. The last car, facing away from the camera and standing on the running board is local Okanogan newspaper editor, O.H. Woody. Next to him is the editor of the Riverside paper, Proctor, and lastly is Dr. Fryer of Riverside.";

A part of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, the Conconully Dam directed a surplus of water into a series of canals designed to send irrigation to over 10,000 acres of prime farmland in the Okanogan Valley. In order to end the canal's wasteful seepage of water when en route to designated farms, engineers decided to line all of the canals with concrete to retain the water. This photograph appears to be cut out along the edge of the concrete canal's form, which might be an indication that Matsura used this shot either for an artistically designed display of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, or for his personal scrapbook. The portion shown is a part of the two mile long Main Canal, which supplied water from the Dam and Salmon River straight to the Low and High Line canals.";

By 1910, they retained their shop located in the Judson Murray Building near the corner of Second Avenue and Q (later Queen) Street, but added to it a much needed mortuary business. Mr. McCampbell graduated from the Barnes' School of Anatomy, Sanitary Science and Embalming. Licensed in Chicago, Indiana, and Washington, he was also elected as County Coroner in the 1911 elections. Armstrong continued in the paint store business for a time after that, but had also joined CM Valentine in the real estate business in February of 1910. The two men bought a lot on the SW corner of First and Queen. By 1912, McCampbell and Armstrong had split the partnership, and McCampbell joined with Mr. Wiley Buchanan of Malott to form the corporation of the Okanogan Valley Undertaking Association. They planned to cover the entire valley with its service, which included an automobile hearse. In this picture, taken around 1911 during the Fourth of July Parade in Okanogan, Armstrong and McCampbell showcase their artistic talents on the side of their horse drawn float.";

Engineer Muldrow of Okanogan picked the north side instead. While the grade ran more steep in spots the route held much better resources in terms of road building material, and would not require a bridge.

The railroad would run down the Similkameen River past the Que Ess on to Fish Lake, through the center of the Irrigation Project farmland and Okanogan. However, right-of-way delays and difficulties in finding backers for the projected $30,000 per mile track put an end to the OER.

Licensed in Chicago, Indiana, and Washington, he was also elected as County Coroner in the 1911 elections. Armstrong continued in the paint store business for a time after that, but also joined C.M. Valentine in the real estate business in February of 1910. The two men bought a lot on the SW corner of 1st and Queen. By 1912, McCampbell and Armstrong had split the partnership, and McCampbell joined with Mr. Wiley Buchanan of Malott to form the corporation of the Okanogan Valley Undertaking Association.

Therefore a strong, watertight core was necessary for the dam to work. The strip in the center of the photograph holds the core material, while flumes flank it on either side, dumping rock-fill for the embankment slopes.

Ferbrache stands with his arm extended to the top of a one year old apple tree to demonstrate how even a tree planted on land without the luxury of irrigation is able to flourish in the conducive Okanogan climate. Mr. Ferbrache's farm was located one mile west of town. The year before, in March, Mr. Ferbrache planted 300 apple trees, mostly of the Winesap and Rome Beauty varieties, all of which measured under 18 inches in length. He also grew potatoes in between the rows, selling them at a high enough price to pay for his apple trees.";

His nickname was "Alligator." He was later called Y. T. Woo. He had just passed his entrance exams for Columbia University when the students were recalled. Upon return to China in 1881, he was assigned to the Tongshan mining school where he stayed until 1886, when he was sent to the Royal School of Mines in London. He graduated in 1890 as a fully trained mining engineer, becoming engineer-in-chief of some large silver mines in Jehol. In 1895, he became superintendent of some coal and copper mines near Nanking. In 1899, he became Assistant Director and Chief Chemist for the K'aiping Mining Company. During the Boxer troubles of 1900, he kept the mines from being taken over by the Boxers and Russian troops by organizing the miners into an armed force to guard the mines, while continuing to supply Tientsin with much needed coal. After the K'aiping mining properties were passed into British hands, he stayed on serving in various capacities until his retirement in 1920. He died in Peking in 1939.";

He was nicknamed "Breezy Jack." Upon return to China, he became secretary to Shen Kung Pao, the Managing Director of the China Merchant's Steam Navigation Company. He later served as secretary to various princely envoys which the Chinese Government sent to the United States and Europe. In 1902, he was secretary to the embassy sent to attend the coronation of King Edward VII. In 1904, he accompanied Prince Pu Lun to the United States, where the prince served as Imperial Commissioner at the St. Louis Exposition.

He died in an accident on his way home.<br><br> Yung Leang was known as "By-Jinks Johnnie" during his Hartford days. He became a Captain in the Navy, serving at the Battle of Pagoda. His ship went down and he had to swim to shore. Hungry and slightly injured, with only $3 pay, he made it safely to Foochow. He later served on a flagship during the seige of Weihaiwei. He was an eye witness to the events of the last few days of the Chinese resistance. Yung Leang survived to retirement and is credited with having provided the list of Chinese Educational Mission students printed in the back of LaFargue's book. A note about Yung Leang's true name.
