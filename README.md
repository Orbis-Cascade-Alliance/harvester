harvester
=========

XForms-based OAI-PMH harvester for Orbis Cascade. Metadata are transformed into RDF conforming to the DPLA Metadata Application Profile and posted into a triplestore (Apache Fuseki) for access from finding aids.

The application would be generalizable to other archival consortia. For further documentation on installation, the data model, and workflows, see the [wiki](https://github.com/Orbis-Cascade-Alliance/harvester/wiki) for this respository.
